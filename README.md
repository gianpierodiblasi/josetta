A Java to ES6 Transpiler (WORK IN PROGRESS!!!!)

## Description
![josetta.jpeg](https://github.com/gianpierodiblasi/josetta/blob/master/josetta.jpeg?raw=true)

josetta is the inverted acronym of A Transpiler To ES6 of Old Java, or if you prefer is the union of Java and
[Rosetta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_Stone).

Aside from these funny word games, josetta is my personal attempt to develop a Java to ES6 translator. josetta is used in my other
projects so its development follows my needs in those projects. As a result, only a small fraction (probably less than 10%) of 
all Java specifications are correctly handled.
